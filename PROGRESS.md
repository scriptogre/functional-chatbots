## Context

### Update: Dark Mode & Fullscreen Mode

The UI now has **2 checkboxes** in the top right corner.

- Left checkbox toggles dark mode.
- Right checkbox toggles fullscreen mode.

The assistant is currently both unable to trigger them, and unaware of their existence.

_(Here it's hallucinating about toggling dark mode and fullscreen mode.)_

The checkboxes use the `hx-post` attribute and their `checked` states depends on the `is_dark_mode` and `is_fullscreen_mode` values in the session. 

Check out `views.py` and `index.jinja` to see how they're implemented.

Here's their current logic, for context:

### Task: Enable the LLM to trigger dark mode & fullscreen mode based on user input

The `views.py` includes some instructions on how to do this.

Good luck fellow Djangonaut! üöÄ

### **Challenges**

1. #### Try to include a 3rd `reasoning` field in the assistant's response schema. It might help improve the assistant's responses' accuracy.
2. #### Make the assistant aware of whether dark and fullscreen modes are active.

# Next Steps

Switch to the `4-client-events-solution` branch to see the solution.
```bash
git switch 4-client-events-solution
```
